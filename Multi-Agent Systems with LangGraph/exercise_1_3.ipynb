That could be executing some code, retrieving a local file, running a web search, or performing a math calculation.\n\nAs you progress through this course, you'll build a multi-agent system that can compile financial information, including summaries, stock performance data, and accompanying visualizations of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nLet's start with a single-agent implementation to refresh ourselves on the LangGraph syntax and to create the tools we'll need for the multi-agent case.\n\nIn total, there are three tools required:\n\n1. A tool for retrieving company information from the internet &rarr; Wikipedia\n2. A tool for retrieving stock performance information from a local CSV file\n3. A tool for running Python code to generate the visualizations\n\nLet's start building these tools for your agents to use, beginning with a Wikipedia search tool!","metadata":{},"id":"f3b32852-01fe-4f99-8d46-8acca7253296","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![](images/wikipedia_tool.png)\n\n### 🔎 Tool 1: Wikipedia search\n\nYou'll use the `wikipedia` Python library to perform Wikipedia searches and return informative summaries about different companies. This tool calls Wikipedia's API in the backend, which doesn't require an API key.\n\nThis library has two functions that we'll use to search and summarize company information:\n\n1. `wikipedia.search()`: Search Wikipedia to return the highest-ranking page titles.\n2. `wikipedia.summary()`: Fetch a summary from a given page. The `sentences` argument can be used to control the amount of information (number of sentences) returned.","metadata":{},"id":"b1bcf548-6b0e-4289-b356-c5ba81ca988d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"**Run the installs below to configure your environment for the exercise.**","metadata":{},"id":"68256f61-f18d-45c6-8222-d737f6e098e8","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"!pip install --quiet wikipedia==1.4.0 langchain-core==0.3.59 pydantic==2.11.9","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":2991,"lastExecutedAt":1762572164166,"lastExecutedByKernel":"cd89e51b-7bcc-4f07-992a-1df240316a8b","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"!pip install --quiet wikipedia==1.4.0 langchain-core==0.3.59 pydantic==2.11.9","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":80,"type":"stream"}},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"2d21c528-5e62-401b-8632-aefd53410bb6","cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"\n\u001b[1m[\u001b[0m\u001b[34;49mnotice\u001b[0m\u001b[1;39;49m]\u001b[0m\u001b[39;49m A new release of pip is available: \u001b[0m\u001b[31;49m25.0.1\u001b[0m\u001b[39;49m -> \u001b[0m\u001b[32;49m25.3\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m[\u001b[0m\u001b[34;49mnotice\u001b[0m\u001b[1;39;49m]\u001b[0m\u001b[39;49m To update, run: \u001b[0m\u001b[32;49mpython3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\u001b[0m\n"}]},{"source":"**Complete the code below to define a tool called `wikipedia_tool()` that performs a search on an input `query` and retrieves a summary.**","metadata":{},"id":"7435c28b-8731-4868-b103-a53a81664c76","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from typing import Annotated\nimport wikipedia\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\n\n@tool\ndef wikipedia_tool(\n    query: Annotated[str, \"The Wikipedia search to execute to find key summary information.\"],\n):\n    \"\"\"Use this to search Wikipedia for factual information.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Search using query\n        results = wikipedia.search(query)\n        \n        if not results:\n            return \"No results found on Wikipedia.\"\n        \n        # Step 2: Retrieve page title\n        title = results[0]\n\n        # Step 3: Fetch summary\n        summary = wikipedia.summary(title, sentences=8, auto_suggest=False, redirect=True)\n    except BaseException as e:\n        return f\"Failed to execute.
